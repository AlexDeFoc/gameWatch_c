Main flow:
* list menu opts
* get ui
* based on ui run a opt

List menu opt:
* clear screen
* make array containing the string opts
* run through array and print.
* get user input

New opt:
* clear screen
* ask user for title name
* get user input and store it into title
* open file ptr to "./record", a
* write to file ptr with write format and title gathered from user and time = 0.
* flush file ptr
* close file ptr
* null out file ptr

Remove opt:
* clear screen
* open file ptr to "./record", r
* open tmp file ptr to "./tmp", w
* if record is null print err msg and return
* (print and get ui phase)
* while:
* read line with read format and save it into dummy title, time
* print each one in i. (title, time)
* rewind file ptr
* get user input limited to max of items i we found
* (remove line phase)
* while:
* read line with read format and save it inot dummy title, time
* write dummy title and time into tmp file ptr with write format.
* flush tmp ptr
* close file ptr
* close tmp file ptr
* null out file ptr
* null out tmp file ptr
* remove file from "./record"
* rename "./tmp" to "./record"

List opt:
* clear screen
* open file ptr to "./record", r
* if record is null print err msg and return
* while:
* read line with read format and save it into dummy title, time
* print each one in i. (title, time)
* hold screen

Start opt :
* clear screen
* (list titles phase and get ui)
* open file ptr to "./record", r
* if record is null print err msg and return
* while:
* read line with read format and save it into dummy title, time
* print each one in i. (title, time)
* rewind
* get ui with max based on i val
* clear screen
* (sleep & update phase)
* while 1 :
* sleep 5 minutes
* open tmp file ptr, w
* sub-while :
* read line with read format and dump data into dummy title and time
* clear screen
* print (title, time)
* write to tmp file ptr with write format the title and time + 5
* close tmp file ptr
* null out tmp file ptr
* remove "./record"
* rename "./tmp" to "./record"

Start opt :
* clear screen
* (list & get ui phase)
* open file 
* read file with read format
* get ui
* close file
* (read, write, modify, print & loop phase)
* while:
* sleep thread for 5 minutes
* open file ptr "./record", r
* open tmp file ptr "./tmp", w
* read file ptr with read format & write to tmp file ptr with write format
    * if we reach line i with val same as ui, we write like before but with +5 on time
    * clear screen
    * print (title, time)
* close file ptr
* close tmp file ptr
* null out file ptr
* null out tmp file ptr
* remove file "./record"
* rename fiel "./tmp" with "./record"

todo : while reading lines from record check if return val read is 2 if not then print err msg, hold screen and hault

- !note: this flow note was made before writing the main code,
meaning that there are some safetly and most of the start opt made only in the code and not in the note.
Conclusion: note is not complete but contains most of the logic.
